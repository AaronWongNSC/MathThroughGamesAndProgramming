        <p>
            What experience do you have with internet bots? (Two common types of bots are chatbots and social media bots.)
            What is your understanding of how they work?

        <title>The Greedy Algorithm Program</title>

        <p>
            In the previous section, we looked at the flowchart that represents the greedy algorithm. We are now going
            to translate that flowchart into Python code that a computer can follow. As we work through the flowchart,
            we are going to learn some of the basic concepts of computer programming.

            After leaving the start node, we immediately come to the following node:
        </p>
        <image xml:id="outside-in-greedy-variables" width="30%">
            <latex-image>
                \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1cm]
                    \node (var) [process,minimum width=4cm,text width=4cm,yshift=-0.5cm] {\small $L_0$ = left-most card \\ $R_0$ = right-most card};
                \end{tikzpicture}
            </latex-image>
        </image>
        <p>
            <idx><h>variable, programming</h></idx>
            The purpose of this node is to define some variables. A variable in programming is just a name that represents a value that we want to reference later.
            In this case, we're defining the two variables that we will want to compare.

L0 = game.left(0)
R0 = game.right(0)

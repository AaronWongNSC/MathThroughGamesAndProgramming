        In the previous section, we saw that center markings are useful when you are able to eliminate most of the possibilities
        at a particular position. Sometimes, we want to focus our attention on a particular digit. This section will explore this
        notation and its logic. (Note: Different people may use this notation slightly differently, with different "rules" for how
        they might apply it than what is presented here. Ultimately, it doesn't matter. The point is to practice logic, and the
        way the notation is presented here is logical.)

        <term>Corner markings</term> (also called <term>Snyder notation</term>) can be used to indicate "box-level" logic for some
        digit. The idea is that it's sometimes possible to eliminate most of the possible locations for a digit within a box, which
        then opens up further avenues of logic. You first start by identifying the possible locations for the digit within a box.
        Every possible location for that digit is indicated by writing that digit in small font in one of the corners of the square
        for each position. You can sometimes use this information to help you make further inferences.

        A common use for corner markings is a dual-purpose box and row/column indicator. Consider the following situation:

        Think about the possible positions for 1 in box 3. We can see that there is no room for it in row 3, and the 1 in
        box 2 eliminiates all of row 2. Therefore, 1 must be in row 1 of box 3. So we can write a small 1 in each of those
        three boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
        But we can actually go further with this and place the 1 in box 1. Since the corner markings in box 3 are all in row 1,
        we know that no matter what the final solution of the puzzle looks like, the 1 in row 1 will be somewhere in box 3. In
        particular, this means that there cannot be a 1 in row 1 of box 1. And since the 1 in row 2 is already found in box 2,
        this means that the 1 in box 1 must be in row 3, where there is only one possibility. The next grid attempts to visualize
        this logic.

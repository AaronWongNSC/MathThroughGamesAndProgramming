                    You will learn how to draw inferences in a Sudoku without needing to know the exact position of a digit.

        CAREFUL LOGIC/REASONING VS. FAST/INTUITIVE REASONING
    </observation>

    <p>
        In the previous section, we saw that there are times when you can determine the exact location of a digit based on the
        immediate positions of other digits on the page. We can consider that to be "first level" reasoning. But some Sudokus
        require you to use multiple levels of inference. But before we talk about that, we need to introduce two useful notations.

            Consider the Sudoku grid below:

            In the first row, we can see that all the numbers except for 8 and 9 are present. This means that
            the empty squares at the right side must be either an 8 or a 9. Similarly, the empty squares in
            column 1 must be either an 8 or a 9. And for box 6, the missing values are 6 and 7.

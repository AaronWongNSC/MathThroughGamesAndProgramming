        Sudoku is a classic pen-and-paper puzzle. (A pen-and-paper puzzle is a puzzle that can be given to you on
        paper and solved using just a pen and your brain.) If you look around, you will be able to find all sorts of
        puzzle books that contain them, as well as dozens of websites or apps that let you access gigantic libraries
        of puzzles.

        The standard Sudoku grid is a 9x9 square grid that has been broken up into 9 3x3 boxes. A valid Sudoku grid is
        one in which every square in the grid is filled with one of the digits from 1 to 9 subject to the condition that
        each digit appears in every row, column, and box exactly once. The diagram below shows a valid Sudoku grid with
        a row, column, and box highlighted to help you verify that the condition has been met.

        A typical puzzle starts with only some of the squares filled with digits, and it is up to the player to fill in
        the remaining digits to get a valid Sudoku grid. A well-constructed puzzle will lead to the ability to complete
        the grid using logic and without guessing. Solving the puzzle by guessing somewhat defeats the purpose of the
        puzzle, which is the practice and experience of reasoning and pattern-recognition to reap the reward of a sense
        of accomplishment.

        The goal of the next few sections is to introduce some of the logic that can be applied in an attempt to solve the
        puzzle. In this section, we will start by simply using the process of elimination to solve for specific entries. Here
        is a very simple application:
    </p>
    <image xml:id="sudoku-elimination-1" width="75%">
        <latex-image>
            \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]

                \draw (0,0) grid (9,9);
                \foreach \x in {0,3,6} {
                    \foreach \y in {0,3,6} {
                        \draw[very thick] (\x, \y) rectangle (\x + 3, \y + 3);
                    }
                }

                \draw (0.5,8.5) node[anchor=center] {8};
                \draw (1.5,8.5) node[anchor=center] {2};
                \draw (2.5,8.5) node[anchor=center] {};
                \draw (3.5,8.5) node[anchor=center] {6};
                \draw (4.5,8.5) node[anchor=center] {1};
                \draw (5.5,8.5) node[anchor=center] {3};
                \draw (6.5,8.5) node[anchor=center] {9};
                \draw (7.5,8.5) node[anchor=center] {7};
                \draw (8.5,8.5) node[anchor=center] {5};

                \draw (8.5,0.5) node[anchor=center] {9};
                \draw (8.5,1.5) node[anchor=center] {8};
                \draw (8.5,2.5) node[anchor=center] {};
                \draw (8.5,3.5) node[anchor=center] {2};
                \draw (8.5,4.5) node[anchor=center] {3};
                \draw (8.5,5.5) node[anchor=center] {1};
                \draw (8.5,6.5) node[anchor=center] {7};
                \draw (8.5,7.5) node[anchor=center] {4};


                \draw (3.5,5.5) node[anchor=center] {3};
                \draw (4.5,5.5) node[anchor=center] {2};
                \draw (5.5,5.5) node[anchor=center] {8};

                \draw (3.5,4.5) node[anchor=center] {9};
                \draw (4.5,4.5) node[anchor=center] {};
                \draw (5.5,4.5) node[anchor=center] {6};

                \draw (3.5,3.5) node[anchor=center] {5};
                \draw (4.5,3.5) node[anchor=center] {4};
                \draw (5.5,3.5) node[anchor=center] {1};
            \end{tikzpicture}
        </latex-image>
    </image>
    <p>
        Based on the rules of the game, you should be able to easily identify the missing value in the middle
        box and in the row and column with 8 out of the 9 entries completed.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Now consider the following scenario:
    </p>
    <image xml:id="sudoku-logic-1-1" width="75%">
        <latex-image>
            \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
                \draw (0,0) grid (9,9);
                \foreach \x in {0,3,6} {
                    \foreach \y in {0,3,6} {
                        \draw[very thick] (\x, \y) rectangle (\x + 3, \y + 3);
                    }
                }
                \draw (1.5,6.5) node[anchor=center] {1};
                \draw (2.5,3.5) node[anchor=center] {1};
                \draw (6.5,2.5) node[anchor=center] {1};
                \draw (4.5,1.5) node[anchor=center] {1};
            \end{tikzpicture}
        </latex-image>
    </image>
    <p>
        It is possible to place the 1 in the bottom left box by simply applying the process of elimination.

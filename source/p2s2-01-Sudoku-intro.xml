        Sudoku is a classic pen-and-paper puzzle. (A pen-and-paper puzzle is a puzzle that can be given to you on
        paper and solved using just a pen and your brain.) If you look around, you will be able to find all sorts of
        puzzle books that contain them, as well as dozens of websites or apps that let you access gigantic libraries
        of puzzles.

        The standard Sudoku grid is a 9x9 square grid that has been broken up into 9 3x3 boxes. A valid Sudoku grid is
        one in which every square in the grid is filled with one of the digits from 1 to 9 subject to the condition that
        each digit appears in every row, column, and box exactly once. The diagram below shows a valid Sudoku grid.

        A typical puzzle starts with only some of the squares filled with digits, and it is up to the player to fill in
        the remaining digits to get a valid Sudoku grid.

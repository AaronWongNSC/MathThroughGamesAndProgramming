        CAREFUL LOGIC/REASONING VS. FAST/INTUITIVE REASONING
    </observation>

    <p>
        In the previous section, we saw that there are times when you can determine the exact location of a digit based on the
        immediate positions of other digits on the page. We can consider that to be "first level" reasoning. But some Sudokus
        require you to use multiple levels of inference. But before we talk about that, we need to introduce some notation.

    <p>
        Consider the Sudoku grid below:

        In the first row, we can see that all the numbers except for 8 and 9 are present. This means that
        the empty squares at the right side must be either an 8 or a 9. Similarly, the empty squares in
        column 1 must be either an 8 or a 9. And for box 6, the missing values are 6 and 7.
    </p>

        <idx><h>center markings</h></idx>
        Even though we don't know exactly which number goes where, we have been able to narrow the options
        considerably and create an exhaustive list of possibilities for those positions. When you generate
        such lists of values, it is helpful to be able to write it down in a way that you can reference later.
        The technique for this is known as <term>center markings</term>, and all you do is write down all the
        possibilities in the middle of the square, being sure to write it small so that you can visually spot
        that it's different very quickly and easily. Here's how that looks for the grid above.

        This notation works best when you've reduced the number of possibilities to just two or three, though there
        can be times that insights can be generated from listing more possibilities. The value of this notation is that
        it allows you to more easily determine when you can solve that position because it helps you to remember that
        you've already eliminated the other possibilities. Otherwise, you would likely have to go back and check them
        all again to feel confident that you're correct.
    </p>
    <p>
        Center markings have other useful properties. For example, if you have the same two center markings in a row,
        column, or box, then you can use that information to eliminate possibilities elsewhere in that row, column, or box.
        Try to determine the value in row 1 column 1 of the following grid:

    <p>
        Let's focus on the pair of center markings in box 1. (This would often be referred to as a "12-pair", which is 
        read as "one-two pair.") The conclusion we can draw is that none of the other values in that box can be either a
        1 or a 2. If we were to put a 1 somewhere else in the box, it would eliminate 1 as a possibility from both of those
        positions, and that would say that they must both be a 2, which would violate the rules. So this eliminates 1 and 2
        as possible values for the top left corner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the same logic, but applied to row 1, we can see that the top left corner cannot be either an 8 or a 9 because
        of the 89-pair at the right side of that row. From here, we can also use row and column logic to eliminate 3, 4, 6, and
        7 as possibilities. And so we have a naked single 5 in the top left corner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pairs (and triples, quadruples, quintuiples...) can be combined with other elements of Sudoku logic when solving a puzzle.
        In the grid below, see if you can place the digit 1 in box 1.

        Hopefully, you were able to identify that the 1 belongs in row 3 column 2. The 123-triple in box 3 eliminates
        the 1 from row 1 (since it must be in one of those three positions), and the 12-pair in box 2 eliminates the 1
        from row 2. This reduces us to looking at columns 2 and 3 in box 1 since the 9 is occupying column 1. And the
        last step is to eliminate column 3 because there is a 1 in column 3 of box 4.

<div class="para"> Each of the flowcharts we created is a set of instructions to be followed in odrer to complete a specific task. The only gap between understanding those flowcharts and computer programming is understanding how to get the computer to follow the flowchart. The specific way that this is done is through something called a <dfn class="terminology">programming language</dfn>, which is basically a translation tool that runs between humans and computers. While there are many languages that are available, we will use <dfn class="terminology">Python</dfn> because it is among the easier languages to use when getting started in programming.</div>

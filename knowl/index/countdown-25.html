<div class="para"> If the gmae state has reached a terminal node, the game is over. In 15-Countdown, the player who takes the last token is the winner, which means that the player that moved the game to the terminal node is the winner. Another way to think about this is that is supposed to move next has no legal moves (since there are no edges leaving the terminal node), and that is what makes them lose. This is known as the "normal play condition" and stands in contrast to the "mis√®re condition" in which the player who cannot move is the winner.</div>

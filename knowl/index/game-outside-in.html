<div class="para">Outside-In is a two-player game. The game is played with with a standard deck of cards. The cards are shuffled and an even number of cards are laid out in a row. (A recommended number of cards is 10.) Players take turns drawing a single card from either end of the row. The playerâ€™s score is the sum of the values of all the cards they collect during the game, where aces are worth 1, number cards are worth the number, jacks are worth 11, queens are worth 12, and kings are worth 13. The player with the most points wins the game.</div> <div class="para">Note that this game can also be played with domino tiles (with value equal to the number of dots) or any other objects that can be given a definite value.</div>

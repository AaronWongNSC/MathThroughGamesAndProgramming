<div class="para"> Even though we don’t know exactly which number goes where, we have been able to narrow the options considerably and create an exhaustive list of possibilities for those positions. When you generate such lists of values, it is helpful to be able to write it down in a way that you can reference later. The technique for this is known as <dfn class="terminology">center markings</dfn>, and all you do is write down all the possibilities in the middle of the square, being sure to write it small so that you can visually spot that it’s different very quickly and easily. Here’s how that looks for the grid above.</div>

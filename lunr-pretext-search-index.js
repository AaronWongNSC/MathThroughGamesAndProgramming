  "body": " A Simple Question with a Complicated Answer     You will learn to defininition of a game for the purposes of this course.    You will learn how to determine whether an activity is a game for the purposes of this course.     Make a list of games that you've played. Are there any common features about the items in your list? Do these features apply to all games? If not, what features do you believe are shared by all games?  What is a game? Since everyone has some experience playing games, it's not hard to think of examples of games. Some people might think of board games (chess, Monopoly, and Settler's of Catan are just a few examples). Some people might think of first-person shooters like Call of Duty, or any number of console games that can be found on the Nintendo Switch or XBox. There are also games involving cards like poker and Blackjack.  But then there's also a gray area. Is a jigsaw puzzle a game? What about logic puzzles and Sudoku? Or what about playing \"Peek-A-Boo\" with a baby? As you think about it longer, the boundary between what is a game and what is not a game starts to get fuzzy.  And this leads us back to the question: What is a game? We're not going to try to come up with a definition that defines all possible games. That type of categorization can be interesting, but it can also lead to endless debates that distract from the larger ideas. The real purpose of this definition is to set the stage for this course. When we talk about a game in this course, we are only talking about certain types of games and not all possible games. So with that in mind, here is the definition.   Trying to make universal definitions can lead to debates such as whether a hot dog is a sandwich or whether cereal is a soup.    Game  game   A game is an activity with a set of well-defined rules, well-defined decision points, and well-defined outcomes.    Mathematicians use the term \"well-defined\" in formal mathematical contexts to mean that the idea or object can be determined unambiguously. In other words, it can be determined in a manner that everyone can look at it and agree on what it is. The use of that term here is (unfortunately) not quite as precise, as there is still some wiggle room for the concepts. However, for this course, it's close enough. We will elaborate on the ideas and then just leave the gray areas as gray areas.     Well-defined rules: The rules are written in a way that makes it absolutely clear how to play the game. Everyone who carefully reads and follows the rules will end up playing the same game.     Well-defined decision points: The types of games we will be analyzing need to be clear about when decisions need to be made and what the possible decisions are at any moment. A simple way to think about this is that at any point in the game, it makes sense to ask the questions \"Whose turn is it?\" and \"What are the valid moves?\"     Well-defined outcomes: After a decision has been made, it must be clear what happens next, and it must be the same thing would happen to any other player that makes the same decision in an identical situation. This part of the definition is a bit tricky to interpret, and leaves a little bit of room for ambiguity. One thing we want to avoid is the outcome being dependent upon the individual and not the structure of the game. For example, in a game like darts, the outcome of a throw is not a random event like throwing a die. The outcome is not driven by the rules of the game, but by the skill of the individual, which means that the outcomes are not well-defined.    With this in place we can look at a number of games and see whether they meet our definition. Again, things that fall outside of the definition can still be games in the general sense. It's just that they aren't the types of games we will be analyzing.    Chess:   Well-defined rules: There is a clear set of rules for how every piece moves and how they interact with each other. There are a few special moves (castling and en passant) that violate the basic pattern of movement, but these special situations are clearly laid out in an unambiguous manner.  Well-defined decision points: This is a two=player game where the players take turns, and there is a clear set of valid moves for each turn.  Well-defined outcomes: When a piece is moved to a new position, the game's structure defines the outcome.  From this, we conclude that chess is a gmae.     Monopoly:   Well-defined rules: The game comes with instructions that clearly describe how the game is to be played. However, a lot of people play with various \"house rules\" (such as collecting money on Free Parking) that deviate from the official rules. As long as everyone can understand and agree with how the rule is meant to be implemented, it continues to have well-defined rules. (On a technical note, we would probably say that they are playing a variant of Monopoly instead of just Monopoly.)  Well-defined decision points: If we ignore the auction phase of the game, the game proceeds in an organized manner, with players taking their turns in a specific order, and having a clear set of options in front of them at any moment. But the existence of the auction potentially violates this. If the auction requires players to bid with no specific order (first to call out a number owns the bid), the auction phase lacks clear decision points. If the auction is run by taking turns bidding, then there are clear decision points.  Well-defined outcomes: When a player lands on a space, there is a clear outcome based on the rules of the game.  From this, we conclude that Monopoly is a gmae if the auction is run in a particular manner.     Sudoku: This one is a bit tricky. In this course, we will consider certain types of logic puzzles to be games, so we have to be a little bit flexible in how we interpret the conditions.   Well-defined rules: The game is played by a person writing numbers into the squares of the puzzle. There is a clear set of rules for what those numbers could be.  Well-defined decision points: The decision points for a Sudoku are when the player commits a certain value to a certain position on the grid. In this sense, the game is played by a clear sequence of moves as the player slowly fills out the grid.  Well-defined outcomes: A particular entry may be valid or invalid, depending on whether the player has made a mistake. The player's lack of knowledge of their move is part of the game. As the grid is filled out more completely, the player \"loses\" if they find that they cannot legally write a digit into some position of the grid. But the player \"wins\" if they fill out the entire grid and all the rules are satisfied.  From this, we can see that a Sudoku can be considered to be a game for this course. Whether one ultimately decides to consider puzzles as games is a decision that is left to the individual.     As we explore the topic more deeply, we will develop specific tools for analyze games, and this will bring these ideas more clearly into focus.   Exercises   The Definition of a Game  For each of the following activities, determine whether it is a game based on our definition. If it is not a game, describe which of the properties it violates. Note that some of these may be debatable. Discussion about disagreements with others is encouraged.  Checkers  Billiards  Poker  A slot machine  Scrabble  A game of tag  Jigsaw puzzles  Fortnight  Make a list of 3-5 games (in the casual sense) that you've played in your life. Which of them would be classified as a game (in the formal sense of this class)?  Try to identify a game that is in a gray area based on the definition provided. Which of the three conditions leads to an unclear result? Explain your answer.    "

  "title": "Organizing the World of Games",
  "body": " Organizing the World of Games     You will learn that games can be organized into many different groups based on how the games are played.    You will learn the difference between games of perfect and imperfect information.    You will learn the difference between symmetric and asymmetric games.    You will learn how to play Nim.     What types of genres of games do you enjoy? What do you enjoy about them?  One of the major goals of mathematical thinking is the ability to organize objects into groups based on their properties. The first layer of this is determine whether something is a game. But once we have a game, there are many additional ways to continue to try to categorize it.  One of the first ways you might think of organizing a game is based on the number of players. Chess is a game played by two players. Board games commonly accommodate two to four players. And a game like Sudoku is a single player game.  We can also consider whether a game includes an element of chance or does not. Chance is introduced into a game any time there is some type of randomizing element. This can be in the form of rolling dice, spinning a wheel, or drawing cards. In some contexts, it can be helpful to imagine that chance is just another player in the game. For example, instead of rolling a die, you can imagine that the player \"chance\" is simply selecting a number from 1 to 6. But for our purposes, we will hold the view that is part of the game and not a player.  Another property of a game is whether the there is information that is hidden from some or all of the players. For example, one of the reasons poker is interesting is because the each player has their own cards that nobody else can see, and one of the challenges is to try to figure out what cards the other players might be holding based on how they are behaving. In a game like Monopoly, there is a stack of cards (Chance or Community Chest) and the players aren't allowed to peek at them in advance. This means that when a player lands on one of those positions, information that was hidden becomes revealed to all of the players. Another way that information can be hidden is when there is an element of chance. An outcome may depend on which number is rolled, and none of the players have access to that information. The opposite of this is a gmae where all the information is in front of the players from the very beginning. The games of chess and checker are examples of this. There is no part of the game that his hidden from the players. We have special terms for these game types.   Games with Perfect and Imperfect Information  perfect  imperfect  incomplete  complete   A game with perfect information is a game in which all the players have access to all of the information in a game. A game with imperfect information is a game in which at least one of the players does not have access to all of the information in a game. This includes players not knowing the outcome of future chance events. Some people use the terms complete and incomplete information instead of perfect and imperfect information, respectively.    Most people are familiar with games in each of the above categories, as the typical types of games that people play include games on both sides of the line for each of the divisions. But there are still more ways to categorize games. These categories are generally intuitive to understand, but it may be harder to think of examples.  Games can be either competitive or cooperative. A cooperative game is one where all of the players win or lose as a single team. There are plenty of examples of these types of games, but they are likely less familiar to the average person. Instead, most people are able to think of competitive games. These are games where, at the end of the game, some players win and some players lose. It's important to note that competitive games may involve some elements of cooperation, where you might develop temporary alliances because you can attain some sort of benefit from it.  A more abstract way of looking at games is to consider the possible moves for each player. In some games, each player has their own pieces that they control, and so each player has a different set of possible moves at any given moment in the game. But there are some games in which all players have the exact same possible decisions all the time. We will start with the formal definition.   Symmetric and Asymmetric Games  symmetric (game)  asymmetric (game)   A symmetric game is a game for which both players have identical options at any decision point during the game. An asymmetric game is a game where one player has an option available to them that the other player (or players) do not.    Any game where each player has their own pieces to move is an asymmetric game. For example, chess is an asymmetric game. The word \"identical\" in this definition is a key point to focus on. Even though chess starts off with the pieces in a mirror image of each other, and both players move their corresponding pieces in the same way, that's not what is meant by identical. When it's white's turn, they can move a white pawn in a certain way. But if it were black's turn, they would not be able to move that same white pawn in the same way. They are forbidden from moving any of white's pieces at all! So when you think about identical moves, you want to think of it as literally being able to do the exact same thing in the exact same way.  A symmetric game that you might know is called \"Nim.\" This is an example of a heap game, which is just a general term for games that are played with tokens that are put into piles (heaps), and the gmae is played by manipulating those heaps. These games are convenient because they can be played with objects that are just lying around. Examples of convenient tokens are coins, beans, or small stones. We will explain the rules of the game and then discuss why it's a symmetric game.   Nim  nim   Nim is two-player heap game. Players take turns selecting a heap and removing any number of tokens from it. The player who takes the last token from the last remaining heap is the winner.  A common starting arrangement is to have one heap of size three, one heap of size five, and one heap of size seven. However, the game can start with any number of heaps with any number of tokens in them.    Nim Video Instructions    Video instructions for Nim    This is a symmetric game because both players have access to the exact same moves from any position. There is no sense in which one player has their own heaps that the other player can't take from. All the heaps are neutral and when it's each player's turn they have the same rules for how they can make their next move.  We will close this section by introducting a useful concept for talking about games.   Game State  game state   At any instant for any game, the game state is the collection of all of the information necessary to describe the current game decision point.    For Nim, the game state is the list of all of the heaps with the number of tokens in each heap. We do not need to know whose turn it is because the game is symmetric. The available decisions for either player is the same. For checkers, the game state is the position of every checker on the board and which color is next to move. We need to know whose turn it is because that tells us which pieces are available to be moved.  Thinking about game states will be useful for us as we start to analyze games. It's important to note that the game state does not necessarily contain the information about how you got to that point. For example, the game state for Nim might be that there is only one heap with three tokens in it. We have no idea what combination of moves actually got us to this position. It turns out that (at least for this game) how you got to a position is irrelevant for how you strategize moving forward.   Exercises   Identifying Features of Games  For each of the following games, identify the following features:   The number of players (it may be a range of numbers)    Whether it is a game with or without chance    Whether it is a game with complete or incomplete information    Whether it is a cooperative or competitive game    Whether it is a symmetric or asymmetric game     Chess  Poker  Scrabble  Nim  Monopoly    Exploring Nim  Later in the course, we are going to learn some formal techniques for analyzing games. But for now, we will simply use intuition and experience to analyze the game (tools that everyone has access to).  Suppose that it's your turn, and there is only one heap with four tokens in it. What is your best play and why? Can you generalize from this situation and come up with a strategy for similar sitations?  Suppose that it's your turn, and there are two heaps remaining. One heap has 4 tokens and the other heap has just 1 token. What is your play and why? Can you generalize from this situation and come up with a strategy for similar situations?    "

  "body": " Countdown Games     You will learn how to play 15-Countdown.    You will learn how to represent the game state of 15-Countdown using a graph.     Have you ever tried to analyze a game to figure out how to play it better? What sorts of things did you do to perform your analyses? Were you able to improve? For the purposes of this discussion, you can use a more expansive concept of a game to include all forms of games rather than the narrow definition we use throughout the course.  This chapter is a study of two-player games with perfect information. This means that both players have all of the information about the game (no hidden information) and that there is no element of chance. The most classic game of this type is probaby chess. Unfortunately, chess is far too complex of a gmae for us to analyze, and most modern analyses of the game rely on sophisticated computer programs to assist them.  In order for us to begin our journey of learning how to analyze these types of games, we are going to need to start with something much more simple. The game we will start with is called the 15-Countdown game.   The names of many of the games in this course are arbitrary, and you may find that other people call them by other names or play with slightly different rules. These materials will always provide the rules for a game that is used any type of analysis in order to ensure that everyone is on the same page.    15-Countdown  15-countdown   15-Countdown is two-player heap game. The game starts with one heap of 15 tokens. Players take turns removing either one, two, or three tokens from the heap. The player who takes the last token in the heap is the winner.    15-Countdown Video Instructions    Video instructions for 15-Countdown    Whenever you are introduced to a new game, it will be good to play it a few times to help you understand the rules of the game and start to build some intuition. This is best done with a friend, but it's also possible for you to play against yourself.  One of the first strategic observations of this game is that if there are three or fewer tokens left, then the next player should win the game by taking all of the tokens. This is a rather trivial observation, as it merely represents that you understand the goal of the game and the rules for taking tokens.  But it turns out that this observation helps to lead us to our first non-trivial strategic insight. When there are exactly four tokens left, the next player is guaranteed to lose if their opponent does not make a mistake. (Before reading further, you should see if you can justify this statement for yourself!) We will demonstrate that this is the case by looking at all of the possible decisions that the next player can make, and show that the other player always has a pathway to victory.    If the next player takes one token, then there will be three tokens remaining. The other player can take all three tokens to win the game.    If the next player takes two tokens, then there will be two tokens remaining. The other player can take both tokens to win the game.    If the next player takes three tokens, then there will be one token remaining. The other player can take it to win the game.    It will be helpful for us to develop some tools to help us to visualize and analyze the games that we're discussing.   Graph  graph  node  directed edge   A graph is a collection of nodes (which are typically represented by a dot, an open circle, or a box) and a collection of directed edges (which are typically represented as an arrow) that point from one node to another.    Technically, this is known as a directed graph because all of the edges have a direction. A general graph simply has edges with no direction to them. We are not going to make a big deal about this distinction because all of the graphs we will encounter in this course are directed graphs and there is little value in concerning ourselves with the more general case.  In our context, each node represents a particular game state, and the edges represent the ways that the game can progress from one state to the next by the player's actions. Here is a graph that represents the next move when there are just four tokens remaining.     The number inside the circle represents the number of tokens remaining, which is enough to define the game state for this analysis. The edges represent different moves we can make. In this case they are unlabeled because it's easy enough to figure out how many tokens are being taken to get to the other nodes, but in some cases it may be helpful to label the edges with additional information.  From this image, we can easily see that when there are four tokens left, it is possible to get down to one, two, or three tokens remaining. But this graph is incomplete in the sense that it only gives us information for one move. Let's see what this looks like if we include all the things that can happen next.     While this is an accurate picture of all of the ways that the game can play out, it's not a very good picture of how the game would play out between two people who were playing to win. If there are only three tokens left, nobody that is playing well would ever just take two tokens to give their opponent the victory. So instead of building out a full tree, it will be better to draw out a simplified tree where we leave out the moves that are bad. If we simplified this graph and changed the positions of the arrows to make it more legible, it would look like this.     Instead of representing how the game might play out, we've now got a picture that shows how the game ought to play out (as long as both players are smart and are playing to win). This shows us that if there are only one, two, or three tokens remaining, that the next player should take all of the tokens to leave zero (and win).  The zero node is important to us in our analysis because it represents that the game has ended. We can see this in the graph because there are no arrows that leave it to move us to another game state. Once this state has been reached, there is no more game left to play. We have a special name for these nodes.   Terminal Node  terminal node   A terminal node is a node in a graph that has no edges leaving it.     normal play condition  misère condition If the gmae state has reached a terminal node, the game is over. In 15-Countdown, the player who takes the last token is the winner, which means that the player that moved the game to the terminal node is the winner. Another way to think about this is that is supposed to move next has no legal moves (since there are no edges leaving the terminal node), and that is what makes them lose. This is known as the \"normal play condition\" and stands in contrast to the \"misère condition\" in which the player who cannot move is the winner.  Let's take the idea of representing the game using a graph to its most extreme end. Here is the graph that represents a full game of 15-Countdown.     Our goal would be to do some sort of analysis to this to find winning moves similar to what happened with the graph representing just 4 or fewer tokens remaining. The rest of this chapter will investigate different ways of trying to identify winning moves in a game.  It shouldn't be too much of a surprise that 15-Countdown is just one of many possible games of that type. For example, it's not hard to imagine starting with 17 tokens instead of just 15. And we can also imagine that the rules may allow you to take away different numbers of tokens. There are infinite numbers of these variants. In order to put them all under one umbrella, we're going to introduce a game to capture all of them.   Generalized Countdown  generalized-countdown   The Generalized Countdown game is a generalization of 15-Countdown. Instead of starting with 15 tokens in a single heap, you can start with any number of tokens in a single heap. And instead of being able to take just 1, 2, or 3 tokens, you can pick any numbers of tokens as the legal moves. The winner is the player who takes the last token.  Note: In order to guarantee that a player can always take the last token, you need to include the option of taking 1 token. If you do not want to allow a player to take 1 token, then the end game condition can be altered to be that the player who makes the last legal move is the winner.  For example, you might start with 18 tokens and players can only remove 1, 3, or 6 tokens on their turn.   Generalized Countdown Video Instructions    Video instructions for 15-Countdown      Exercises   15-Countdown Scenarios  Suppose it is your turn and there are 5 tokens remaining. What move would you make and why? (Hint: list your possible moves and then think about how your opponent might respond to each of those situations.)  Suppose it is your turn and there are 6 tokens remaining. What move would you make and why? (Hint: You might find it helpful to use your analysis of the 5 token scenario in your analysis.)    The Genearlized Countdown Game  Choose your own Generalized Countdown game and draw a graph to represent all possible games.    Exploring Nim  For each of the problems in this section, assume you're playing a game of Nim where you start with three heaps whose sizes are 4, 2, and 1.  We can represent the initial game state of this game as (4, 2, 1). This tells us that the first heap has 4 tokens in it, the second heap has 3 tokens, and the third heap has 1. Using this format, make a list of all possible game states. (Hint: You should have 30 total states.)  In math terms, we would call the object (a, b, c) a 3-tuple.   Although we might technically think of the game states (1, 2, 1) and (2, 1, 1) as being different, they are strategically the same scenario. Using this symmetry to shorten your list of game states. You may find it helpful to list the heaps in order of decreasing size. (Hint: There should only be 19 game states now.)  Draw a graph that represents all possible games of Nim with the given setup. You may find it helpful to organize your game states so that the total number of tokens decreases as you move in one direction across your page. (Note: No matter how well you organize things, there will be a very large number of arrows and they will cross over each other a lot.)  Make a list of all of the game states in the Nim game from the previous problem that are one move away from winning. Use this information to draw a simplified graph of this game.    "

  "body": " P-Positions and N-Positions     You will learn what P-positions and N-positions are.    You will learn how the knowledge of P-positions and N-positions improves your strategic play.     Consider the following statements:   I try to make good decisions.    I try to avoid bad decisions.   Do you think these are the same idea? Why or why not?  We are going to start off this section by introducing some vocabulary to describe game states.   P-Position and N-Position  N-Position  P-Position   A P-position in a game is a game state where the player who just played (the previous player) can guarantee a win if they make the right decisions. An N-position in a game is a game state where the next player to play can guarantee a win if they make the right decisions.    In our analysis of 15-Countdown, we saw that if there are one, two, or three tokens and it's your turn, you should just take all of them and win. Since the next player to play has a guaranteed win (if they make the right decisions), this is an N-position.  We also saw that if there are four tokens remaining and it's your turn, that there's nothing you can do to stop your opponent from winning. If you take one, they will take three and win. If you take two, they will take two and win. If you take three, they will take one and win. So if your opponent doesn't make any mistakes, they're going to win. This means the game is in a P-position since the previous player who played has the guaranteed win. Also, notice that the game state of zero tokens is also P-position because the previous player has already won the game, and so they are guaranteed the win.  We can include the labels of P and N in our game trees. Here is how it will look for the endgame of 15-Countdown.     We want to take a moment and think about how these positions interact with each other. Consider the following game tree. The current game state is denoted with an X, and the other nodes are labeled as either a P-position or an N-position.     Let's say that it's your turn. How would you want to play? All we need to do is think about the meaning of the positions. Remember that P-position is a gamestate where the previous player can guarantee a win. Since it's currently your turn, you would want to end your turn on a P-position because that would make you the previous player and the person who is on a path to victory. In theory, it makes no difference which P-position we move to because both of them have a guaranteed win. However, in practice there might be situations where the strategy may be more complicated in one position than the other, and that might lead you to favor the one that's simpler so that you avoid making mistakes.  This analysis shows us something very important and useful about our decisions. If it is our turn to make a move, then we should be looking to move the game to a P-position. In fact, if you are able to make a move from the current position to a P-position, then that would make the current position a N-position since the next player (you) are able to make a move that guarantees a win.  If we are unable to move the game to a P-position, then all the edges must point to N-positions. This means that no matter what move you make, you'll leave the game in a position where your opponent has a move that can guarantee a win. Since we are analyzing two-player games, your opponent is the previous player, and they have the winning move, so that makes this a P-position.  These two observations give us our first theorem. (A theorem is a fancy mathematical term for a result that we know is true.)   Characterizing P-Positions and N-Positions   A node in a game tree is an N-position if one of the edges points to a P-position. If there are no edges that point from a particular node to an P-position (that is, all of the edges point to N-positions), then that node must be an P-position.    We can confirm this result by looking at the 15-Countdown endgame tree. If we look at the N-positions, we can see that each of them has an edge that points to a P-position. And if we look at the P-positions, we can see that all the edges point to N-positions, if there even any edges at all.  In the previous section, there were some exercises that had you analyze 15-Countdown when there are 5 and 6 tokens remaining. You should have found that if there are 5 tokens, the optimal play is to take one token so that there would be 4 remaining. And if there are 6 tokens, then you should take two. Both of these analyses reflect the idea that you're trying to move the game to a P-position.  Let's do a more methodical analysis for 7 tokens. We know that the available moves are to bring the total number of tokens to 6, 5, or 4. We saw that both 6 tokens and 5 tokens are N-positions, and we know from earlier that 4 tokens is a P-position. Since there is a pathway to a P-position, the 7 token position is an N-position and the winning move is to remove three tokens to leave 4. (In the image below, the bad moves have been grayed out for emphasis.)     Now we will analyze the 8 token scenario. We can see that the 7, 6, and 5 scenarios are all N-positions. This means that when there are 8 tokens remaining, there are no winning moves. Since there are no winning moves, the position is not an N-position (the next player cannot win) and so it is a P-position.     In fact, we can push this idea further to analyze the entire game! The key is that we are working backwards, starting from the end of the game and moving towards the beginning. The reason this is helpful is because as we analyze those late game positions, we have more known labels with which to analyze earlier positions.   Exercises   15-Countdown  Complete the analysis of 15-Countdown by continuing to work backwards. Is the initial position a P-position or an N-position? Does that mean that you would want to go first or second? Explain your reasoning.  Make a list of the P-positions you found in your analysis. What is the pattern?  It's one thing to say that X is the right move because that's what the game tree says is the right move, and it's another to be able to describe the strategy based on logic or reasoning applied to the game itself. Can you explain the pattern for winning plays while only referring to the game structures and not the game tree?

What do you think makes a game fun? What do you think makes a game interesting? How are these lists similar and different?    heap games This section is just about teaching you a few more games. All of these games are heap games , which basically means that the games will be played by manipulating piles of tokens. And since tokens can be pretty much anything (rocks, buttons, toothpicks, etc.), the games are accessible to anyone.  The reason we are taking the time to expand the list of games we can play now is so that when we get to working with different types of analysis tools, we will already have a few different games to try them on. This also gives us an opportunity to study the games on their own terms before we start to impose too many mathematical structures on them.   Grundy's Game   Grundy's Game  Grundy's game   Grundy's game is a two-player heap game. The game starts with one heap containing some number of tokens. (10 tokens is a typical starting amount.) Players take turns splitting the heap into two nonempty heaps of different sizes. Play continues until there are no more valid moves. The player who makes the last move is the winner.    Grundy's Game Video Instructions    Video instructions for Grundy's game    If we were starting with 10 tokens, the allowable first moves are to break the heap into 9+1, 8+2, 7+3, or 6+4. But you would not be allowed to do 5+5 because the two heaps are the same size. The next player will then need to make a move from the available heaps. They can only alter one heap each turn.  The rules don't explciitly state how the game ends, but it does tell you the necessary information to figure it out. For a heap of size 1, there are no valid moves because we cannot turn it into two nonempty heaps. For a heap of size 2, you can turn it into two heaps, but they would be the same size. This means that there are no valid moves on heaps of size 2. These heaps are sometimes referred to as \"dead\" heaps because of this.    Wythoff's Game   Wythoff's Game  Wythoff's game   Wythoff's game is a two-player heap game. The game starts with two heap containing a different number of tokens. (A typical starting game has heaps of size 6 and 7.) Players take turns removing tokens from the heaps in one of two ways: (1) They may remove any number of tokens from one of the heaps. (2) They may remove the same number of tokens from both heaps. The player who takes the last token is the winner.    Wythoff's Game Video Instructions    Video instructions for Wythoff's game    Wythoff's game is a variation on Nim. The ability to take tokens from multiple piles at the same time is a new rule that changes the dynamic of the game.  This game is interesting because it can be represented in a completely different manner. Imagine a chess board. A queen sits one space below the top-right corner of the board. Players take turns moving the queen left, down, or diagonally down-left (moves that a queen might normally make in chess). The goal is to be the player that moves the queen to the bottom-left corner.     Initially, these two games may seem completely different from each other. The idea here is not that the game itself (the rules) are exactly the same, but that there is an equivalence between the two games. In mathematical terms, we need to create an isomorphism betweeen the two games. This means that we need to find a way to take a game state in the heap game and match it up with a game state of the chess board game, and we also need to confirm that the valid moves in the heap game correspond to valid moves in the chess board game.  To see how these games are connected, we are going to label the spaces on the chess board with ordered pairs corresponding to their position. The coordinates that we get from this correspond to the sizes of the heaps. Notice that a queen's move left is like taking tokens from the first heap, a queen's move down is like taking tokens from the second heap, and a down-left movement is taking the same number from both heaps.  Another way of saying this is that if I told you a move in the heap game, you could find an equivalent move in the chess board game. And if I told you a move in the chess board game, you could find an equivalent move in the heap game.     Showing that two seemingly different things are basically the same is one of the core skills of mathematical reasoning. We won't see too much of it in this course, but this is an idea that comes up in almost every branch of mathematics, and the ability to see the same concept in multiple ways gives us insight into problems that we might not otherwise have.    Simple Circular Nim   Simple Circular Nim  Simple circular nim   Simple Ciruclar Nim is a two-player heap game. The game starts with a number of tokens placed in a circle. (A typical starting number is 12.) Players take turns removing up to three consecutive tokens. Tokens are not consecutive if there is a gap where a token was removed on a previous turn. The player who takes the last token is the winner.    Simple Circular Nim Video Instructions    Video instructions for Simple Circular Nim    Simple Circular Nim is a variant of Nim, but instead of starting with multiple heaps, the heaps are generated through the moves of the game. As tokens are removed from the circle, it creates gaps which become the borders of the heaps. The players can only take tokens from one heap, so the gaps become part of the strategy.  This game is called \"Simple\" Circular Nim because there's a more complex version of circular nim that is an area of active game theory research. In the more complex version, instead of a circle of individual tokens, the circle consists of heaps of tokens, and the rules for how tokens are taken from the heap are different.    Exercises   Grundy's Game  We observed that for heaps of size 1 and 2, there are no valid moves. For what sizes of heaps is there exactly one valid move?  For what sizes of heaps are there exactly two valid moves?  Create the game tree for Grundy's game starting with 7 tokens. Identify as many P-positions and N-positions as you can.    Wythoff's Game  Make a list of all positions that are one move away from the end of the game (assuming smart players). Are these P-positions or N-positions?  On a chess board, shade in all of the positions that are one move away from the end of the game. Do you think the representation of these positions is eaiser to understand as a list of positions, as a sketch of a chessboard, or do they both seem the same to you?  Consider the position with one heap of one token and one heap of two tokens. Analyze the possible moves. Is this an N-position or a P-position?  Dertermine as many N-positions and P-positions as you can for this game.    Simple Circular Nim  Suppose that all that remains in the game is an even number of single-token heaps. Is this a P-position or an N-position?  Suppose that all that remains in the game is an odd number of single-token heaps. Is this a P-position or an N-position?  Create a game tree for the circular nim game with 6 tokens. Is the starting position a P-position or an N-position?    "

Review the image found at this link: How to Choose the Perfect Board Game . (You will probably need to zoom into the image to read it.) Use it to determine what games you might want to play. Do you recognize the games that they are suggesting? Do you think the guidance is accurate? Are there parts that you disagree with?    Introduction to Flowcharts   flowchart The image in the discussion is an example of a flowchart . A flowchart is a diagram that represents some sort of process. It turns out that there are many types of flowcharts, and in different context they can have different levels of specificity in their structures. We are going to be somewhat loose in our applications of flowcharts, and so we will avoid unnecessary detail and trust that the ideas are sufficiently intuitive.  It is often the case that a flowchart will use different shapes to represent different ideas. We will only consider three shapes:    Oval: Only used for START and STOP.    Rectangle: Used for instructions or behaviors.    Diamond: Used for decisions.    The main idea of a flowchart is that you start from the beginning and \"flow\" from one point to the next, performing actions and making decisions based on information until you reach the end. And if you execute all of the steps correctly, you will have accomplished some sort of task or made a decision.  Let's take another look at the flowchart in the opening discussion. In this case, there's no START oval, but they do clearly indicate where you should begin the process. From there, you follow a series of questions and based on your answers you travel down different paths until you reach a stopping point, which will always be an oval. This chart uses the symbols in a nonstandard way. They use rectangles for questions and then they put the answer inside of diamonds. In spite of this, you can still figure out how everything flows, and that's part of the magic of these charts. They don't need to follow the strictest of rules in order to be understood.  It's worth looking at the precise way that they deviate from the norm. Take a look at the two diagrams below:     The image on the left is how the linked flowchart looks. The image on the right is the more conventional way of displaying a decision. Ultimately, it doesn't really matter (at least at this level) as long as the underlying communication is clear.  Following a flowchart is an exercise in simply following instructions. This is one of the reasons why flowcharts are useful in business. Organizations establish a process, and as long as everyone is following the process, they are in position to get consistent results. But the processes don't need to be business processes. We can also use flowcharts to perform other tasks like sorting objects and identifying P-positions and N-positions from a graph.    A Simple Sorting Algorithm  We are going to start by investigating a simple sorting algorithm. Imagine that we have a collection of cards with numbers on them laid out on a table from left to right. Now imagine that we have a robot that sits at the table whose job it is to sort the cards so that they are in increasing order from left to right. This robot can do three things: (1) Move left and right, (2) Compare the values of two adjacent cards, and (3) Swap two adjacent cards. The diagram below summarizes this information.     Before trying to make a flowchart, let's think about how we might try to get this robot to sort the cards. Since we want larger numbers on the right, it makes sense that if we compare two cards and the larger one is on the left, then we should swap the cards and get the larger one on the right. And the simplest thing to do is to just start from the left and move to the right, comparing at each step. And when the robot reaches the end, just return to the far left and do it again. (We would also need to figure out a way to check if everything is done, but we're just going to pretend that we do that for the robot.) Here is how that flowchart might look:     Take a moment and try to execute this flowchart on the cards 51846 (in that order). Here are some checkpoints for you to compare with to see that you're doing it correctly:  After the first time reaching the far right, the cards are in this order: 15438  After the second time reaching the far right, the cards are in this order: 14358  After the third time reaching the far right, the cards are in this order: 13458  At this point, we can begin to ask questions of our sorting algorithm. Does it always work? How efficient is it? Is there a better method? If this were a course on algorithms, we would take a look at a few others and see how they compare with each other. There are some exercises in this section that will give you some places to explore further, if this interests you.    Labeling Game Trees  In the last couple sections, we have looked at various games and analyzed them to determine whether various positions are P-positions or N-positions. We're going to take a deeper look at this and discover some general approaches to understanding and analyzing game trees.  We will base our process on . This is the result that tells us that the game is in an N-position if there's a move that takes things to a P-position. If no such moves exist, then it's a P-position. This simple rule lets us categorize any position as long as we know the labels of all of the positions that stem from it. (And sometimes, we don't even need to know all of the labels. Can you figure out when this happens?) We can take this idea and turn it into a flowchart that will allow us to label all of the nodes in any game tree.     We're going to use this flowchart to analyze Wythoff's Game ( ) starting with heaps of 2 and 3. We can take inspiration from the isomorphic queen movement game to help us organize the game states into a grid. To make the image less crowded, we've removed the arrowheads and will rely on the fact that all movements must be left, down, or down-left to understand the direction of the moves.     This game only has one termninal node, which is at . Therefore, at the first step of the flowchart, we will label that position a P-position.     We can now see that the positions and have all their moves labeled, so we will analyze those next. Since it is possible to get to a P-position from those nodes (in fact, you can only get to a P-position), these are N-positions.     At this point, we can see that the positions , , and have all their moves labeled. Notice that all of these positions can reach the P-position at , so these are also P-positions.     The next set of nodes that we can analyze are , , and . We can see that and can only reach N-positions, so these must be P-positions. And we can also see that reaches the P-position at , so this is an N-position.     This pattern will continue for two more cycles. The next time will analyze and , both of which are N-positions because they can reach the P-position at . And then the last time through will analyze , which is also an N-position for the same reason the other two were. This gives us the completed analysis of the game tree.     At this point, we can think about how we might present this tree in a way that is easier to read. A common way to \"prune\" the game tree is to simply eliminate the losing moves. This way, when you're looking at the game tree, you don't need to search for the winning moves. This also means that when you are at a P-position there will be no moves shown, and this indicates that any legal move you make is going to be a losing move.  Notice that some positions have multiple winning moves. In these situations, it doesn't matter which winning move you pick since they're all winning moves. In practice, some of these moves may lead to more complex situations, which may lead you to pick the move that creates the simplest pathway to victory as possible. For example, from you can win the game immediately, but you could also move to or . From those positions, it's possible for your opponent to make a move that gives you the chance to make a mistake and lose. And so you might decide it's best to just win outright. But this decision has less to do with the formal logic of the situation and more to do with human error.  Because everything fits nicely on a grid where the moves are all straight lines, we could actually go further with this diagram and eliminate all of the edges completely. We can trust the player to know how the game is played, and it is not difficult to scan the grid for winning moves when you're on a P-position. But it is not typically the case that you can go this far.     Although this process is quite simple, it turns out that this is the key to analyzing any two-player perfect information game (under the normal play condition) assuming that you're able to construct the game tree. The assumption of being able to generate the game tree is where the real challenge lies. The game we just analyzed only has 12 nodes and 38 edges. But it doesn't take much to find games that are significantly more complex. Here are some examples:   Connect 4: This game has 4,531,985,219,092 nodes and was first solved in 1988.  Checkers: This game has approximately 500 quadrillion nodes and was first solved in 2007.  Chess: This has an estimated game states and has not yet been solved.     Exercises   The Game Tree Analysis Algorithm  The analysis algorithm we used in this chapter required us to identify nodes for which all of its moves have been analyzed. However, this is slightly inefficient because we can know that a node is an N-position by knowing that it connects to at least one P-position. Rewrite the flowchart so that it incorporates this observation.  Using the game tree analysis algorithm, analyze 15-Countdown ( ).  Pick parameters for the Generalized Countdown game ( . Then analyze it using the game tree analysis algorithm.  Using the game tree analysis algorithm, analyze Nim ( ) with starting heaps of your choice.    15-Countdown   This is a decision-making flowchart for 15-Countdown.      Suppose you are playing according to this flowchart and there are 13 tokens left. Does the flowchart lead to a winning move? Does this mean that the strategy is good?  In what situations will this flowchart lead to a winning move?  In what situations will this flowchart lead to a losing move?  Create a flowchart that has a winning strategy for this game.    Tic-Tac-Toe   This is a decision-making flowchart for Tic-Tac-Toe.      This is an example of a flowchart that is not fully deterministic. That means it is possible for two people to follow the flowchart, but end up with a different move. Explain how this can happen.  Play several games against an opponent who makes the first move and follows this flowchart. Do you think it's possible to beat your opponent? Explain your reasoning.  Play several games against an opponent who makes the second move and follows this flowchart. Do you think it's possible to beat your opponent? Explain your reasoning.  How might you update this flowchart so that it is fully deterministic?    Collatz Conjecture       Follow the algorithm starting from the number 3. Write down all the values that you work through in the process. How many numbers did you see?  Follow the algorithm starting from the number 13. Write down all the values that you work through in the process. How many numbers did you see?  Pick another 2-digit number and follow the algorithm. Write down all the values that you work through in the process. How many numbers did you see? (Note: You may get unlucky and end up with a very long sequence. If you go more than 50 numbers, just stop.)  Find a Collatz conjecture calculator online and check to see if the values you obtained are correct.   This algorithm is connected to a mathematical idea called the Collatz conjecture. The conjecture states that this algorithm must always eventually stop, regardless of the starting value. It's not obvious that this must happen. For example, you might think that you have to use large numbers to get long sequences. However, if you start with 27, it turns out to take 111 steps to get all the way down to 1. Yet the number 1024 only takes 10 steps!     "

(6 minutes, 17 seconds)   peanut-butter-jelly    CS50 2018 - Lecture 1 - Peanut Butter and Jelly   What was the point of the demonstration?    What is Compupter Programming?  Computer programming is basically the process of giving the computer instructions to follow in order to complete a specific task. People can spend multiple years trying to become proficient at programming, and so it is far beyond the scope of this class to teach you how to program. That said, the underlying logic of computer programming is within reach, and it's something that we have already started to investigate in the previous section.   programming language  Python Each of the flowcharts we created is a set of instructions to be followed in odrer to complete a specific task. The only gap between understanding those flowcharts and computer programming is understanding how to get the computer to follow the flowchart. The specific way that this is done is through something called a programming language , which is basically a translation tool that runs between humans and computers. While there are many languages that are available, we will use Python because it is among the easier languages to use when getting started in programming.  There are a number of ways to get access to Python. If you wanted to download a version of it to your computer, you can find a number of packages that will do it for you (for example, Anaconda Python is popular for data science). If you do this, you will need to understand enough about your computer to navigate the process. Alternatively, you can use a online Python interpreter, which handles all of that for you. And this is the route that we will recommend.   Replit The materials for this course will be housed at Replit . Viewing the files will not require an account, but running them will. (Basic accounts are free at the time of writing.) This will make them accessible to everyone with access to the internet without the hassle of needing to install programs onto their computer.  This is not a course in programming, so there will be many topics and ideas that will be glossed over. The primary goal is for you to understand the large-scale structures of programming without getting lost in the details. If you already have programming experience, you may find it interesting to look through the files to get a deeper understanding of how things are set up, but this is not necessary to be successful in the course. (One of the goals was to make the high level code as human-readable as possible, so you will find that there are a lot of unnecessary functions that clutter things up. None of the code is meant to be taken as an example of coding best practices!)    Outside-In  We are going to use a game-playing bot as our basic programming model. In order to do this, we need to introduce the game that our bot is going to play.   Outside-In  Outside-In   Outside-In is a two-player game. The game is played with with a standard deck of cards. The cards are shuffled and an even number of cards are laid out in a row. (A recommended number of cards is 10.) Players take turns drawing a single card from either end of the row. The player's score is the sum of the values of all the cards they collect during the game, where aces are worth 1, number cards are worth the number, jacks are worth 11, queens are worth 12, and kings are worth 13. The player with the most points wins the game.  Note that this game can also be played with domino tiles (with value equal to the number of dots) or any other objects that can be given a definite value.    Outside-In Video Instructions    Video instructions for Outside-In    After the cards are dealt, this is a game of complete information. Both players can see exactly what options are available at any given moment, and a game tree can be drawn out to analyze the game. That analysis would be slightly different than what we've done previously, as this game is not symmetric and the outcome depends on past decisions. But the idea of mapping out the possible decisions and seeing which ones lead to winning positions can still be applied. The problem is that every new combination and arrangement of cards will require a new game tree analysis, and there are too many possible games for us to analyze them all.  Instead of using a game tree to make decisions, we're going to use a decision-making flowchart. The idea is to try to think strategically about the decisions you're going to make. And the way to start understanding this is to think about what you're thinking about when it's your turn.  Suppose you are playing a game with 10 cards and you are the first player. Here is what you see:     You must either take the 4 on the left or the 5 on the right. But which one will you take? More importantly, what are you thinking about as you try to make your decision? There is no single answer to this question, and here are some possibilities:   You might notice that the 5 on the right is better than the 4 on the left, so that might lead you to take the 5.    However, you might also notice that by taking the 5, you open up the Queen for your opponent to take, and so maybe it's better to play defensively and take the 4 to prevent them from getting the 5.    But you might further recognize that if you take the 5, your opponent might take the Queen, giving you access to take the King. (But they may not take the queen, in which case your scheme doesn't work.)     As you can see, there are lots of layers of thinking that can happen in this game, especially in the first few moves. Our goal is to try to understand a couple different strategies and see how they look as decision-making flowchart.   greedy algorithm (Outside-In) The first strategy we will think about is known as the greedy algorithm . The basic idea is that you're going to look at just the two cards on the end and take the larger one. Here's how it looks as a flowchart:     Notice that we had to include a step for when the two end cards are the same. For simplicity, we just turned that into a random choice, but it is possible to come up with schemes to do better than this.  The notation here may seem a little strange. Why and for the left-most and right-most cards instead of and ? It turns out that both notations are acceptable, but it is common when programming in Python that numbering starts from 0 instead of 1. There are good reasons for this, but it's beyond the scope of this course to get into that.   The reason for starting at 0 has to do with how the numbers are stored in the computer's memory and thinking about the \"first\" number that the computer might use to maximize how high it can count.   We can see that this is something that a machine can follow, which means that you could theoretically program this into a computer and have it play with that strategy. If we had multiple strategies, we could compete them against each other and see whether one strategy is better than another!  In fact, this is what we will discuss in the next section. We will first need to translate the flowchart into Python, then we will see how to make the computer play against itself.

We are now going to translate that flowchart into Python code that a computer can follow. As we work through the flowchart, we are going to learn some of the basic concepts of computer programming.  After leaving the start node, we immediately come to the following node:      variable, programming The purpose of this node is to define some variables. A variable in programming is just a name that represents a value that we want to reference later. In this case, we're defining the two variables that we will want to compare. Here are the two lines of code that accomplish this.   Defining the variables for the greedy algorithm.   L0 = Game.left(0) R0 = Game.right(0)    There is a lot to explain about this code if we were to try to cover all the details about what's happening. Instead, we're going to take a less rigorous approach and convey the general idea of what's happening. The L0 and R0 are the names of the variables that we're creating. You should imagine that Game is the way we reference the list of cards, and the .left() and .right() indicate whether we're looking at the cards starting from the left side or the right side. The number inside the parentheses tells us the number of cards inward from the edge that we need to move. The number 0 in both of these means that we just want the outermost card.

  "title": "Introduction to Sudoku",
  "body": " Introduction to Sudoku     You will learn how to play Sudoku.    You will learn the basic strategies for placing numbers in the grid without guessing.     What is your experience with logic puzzles?  Sudoku is a classic pen-and-paper puzzle. (A pen-and-paper puzzle is a puzzle that can be given to you on paper and solved using just a pen, paper, and your brain.) If you look around, you will be able to find all sorts of puzzle books that contain them, as well as dozens of websites or apps that let you access gigantic libraries of puzzles.  The standard Sudoku grid is a 9x9 square grid that has been broken up into 9 3x3 boxes. A valid Sudoku grid is one in which every square in the grid is filled with one of the digits from 1 to 9 subject to the condition that each digit appears in every row, column, and box exactly once. The diagram below shows a valid Sudoku grid with a row, column, and box highlighted to help you verify that the condition has been met.     A typical puzzle starts with only some of the squares filled with digits, and it is up to the player to fill in the remaining digits to get a valid Sudoku grid. A well-constructed puzzle will lead to the ability to complete the grid using logic and without guessing. Solving the puzzle by guessing somewhat defeats the purpose of the puzzle, which is the practice and experience of reasoning and pattern-recognition to reap the reward of a sense of accomplishment.  The goal of the next few sections is to introduce some of the logic that can be applied in an attempt to solve the puzzle. In this section, we will start by simply using the process of elimination to solve for specific entries. Here is a very simple application:     Based on the rules of the game, you should be able to easily identify the missing value in the middle box and in the row and column with 8 out of the 9 entries completed. The number in row 1 column 2 must be a 4, the number in middle must be a 7, and the number in row 7 column 9 must be a 6. In this case, all the other possibilities were eliminated by their existence in the row, column, or box.  Now consider the following scenario:     Even though there is much less information in this example, we can still place the 1 in the bottom left box using the process of elimination. We can eliminate the possibility of a 1 in any row or column where a 1 already exists. This eliminates all but one of the positions in the box on the bottom left. The following image is a helpful visualization of this idea. The dashed lines are positions where the 1 in the box cannot be located.     In fact, whenever there are four of the same digit \"looking at\" one of the boxes, it must be the case that you can place the digit in that box. Two of the digits eliminate two of the rows, and the other two digits eliminate two of the columns, leaving exactly one row and one column where the digit can be placed.  In most situations, the elimination will occur through a combination of row, column, and box values. Sometimes, certain positions will be blocked by other numbers. You will also typically not know which value could be placed before thinking through the logic of the puzzle. These puzzles will require some practice and patience, but over time you will begin to see the values more quickly.   Exercises   Placing Through Elimination  For each of the following exercises, determine the digit that can be placed and where it must be placed. (Hint: Beware of distractors! Not every digit placed will be relevant to your conclusion!)       "
